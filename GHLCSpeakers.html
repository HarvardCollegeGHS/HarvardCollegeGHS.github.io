She was also a Princeton Project 55 fellow and led communications for New York City Council Member Fernando Cabrera. Brittany holds a Bachelor of Arts degree from Princeton University's Woodrow Wilson School of Public Policy and certificates in Gender and Sexuality Studies and African Studies. Proposed topic: Impactful Global Health Leadership: Start With the (Wo)man in the Mirror The concept of changing the world can be both motivating and overwhelming. Where do we begin? What exciting adventures await? How will we overcome challenges along the way? The road to creating lasting change - especially in the complex field of global health - is long and windy, but it starts with effective leadership. In order to develop into effective global health leaders, we have first examine ourselves in the mirror, coming face to face with our perceptions, our passions, our strengths and our weaknesses. Most importantly, we have to understand that the lens through which we see the world is not the only one. Only once we recognize this can we learn from and collaborate with others in a way that amplifies our impact beyond what any of us alone could ever achieve. Brittany will speak about the importance of self-awareness, humility, and empathy in global health leadership, sharing lessons learned from Global Health Corps' experience developing the next generation of health equity leaders. Aspects of our program she will touch on include: our co-fellow model, our work with partners in Africa and in the U.S., and our efforts to include diverse voices and perspectives at the decision-making tables of global health.

Yuichi Ishii is the Founder and CEO of Family Romance, a company in Tokyo, Japan for renting actors to play the role of family members and friends in the client’s daily life. The company’s name comes from Freud’s “The Family Romance of Neurotics,” an essay published in 1909, about children who believe that their parents are impostors, and that their real parents are nobles or royals. According to Freud, this fantasy is a child’s way of coping with the inevitable, painful experience of disillusionment in his or her parents. Ishii and his “cast” actively strategize in order to engineer transformative outcomes for clients acting as a parent for a fatherless child, a spouse for a widow, or a friend for emotional support.
